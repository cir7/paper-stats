0,Re2TAL: Rewiring Pretrained Video Backbones for Reversible Temporal Action Localization,CVPR2023,"Chen Zhao, Shuming Liu, Karttikeya Mangalam, Bernard Ghanem",2023,"Temporal action localization (TAL) requires long-form reasoning to predict actions of various durations and complex content. Given limited GPU memory, training TAL end to end (i.e., from videos to predictions) on long videos is a significant challenge. Most methods can only train on pre-extracted features without optimizing them for the localization problem, consequently limiting localization performance. In this work, to extend the potential in TAL networks, we propose a novel end-to-end method Re2TAL, which rewires pretrained video backbones for reversible TAL. Re2TAL builds a backbone with reversible modules, where the input can be recovered from the output such that the bulky intermediate activations can be cleared from memory during training. Instead of designing one single type of reversible module, we propose a network rewiring mechanism, to transform any module with a residual connection to a reversible module without changing any parameters. This provides two benefits: (1) a large variety of reversible networks are easily obtained from existing and even future model designs, and (2) the reversible models require much less training effort as they reuse the pre-trained parameters of their original non-reversible versions. Re2TAL, only using the RGB modality, reaches 37.01% average mAP on ActivityNet-v1.3, a new state-of-the-art record, and mAP 64.9% at tIoU=0.5 on THUMOS-14, outperforming all other RGB-only methods.

1,AdaMAE: Adaptive Masking for Efficient Spatiotemporal Learning With Masked Autoencoders,CVPR2023,"Wele Gedara Chaminda Bandara, Naman Patel, Ali Gholami, Mehdi Nikkhah, Motilal Agrawal, Vishal M. Patel",2023,"Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn generalizable representations for image, text, audio, video, etc., by reconstructing masked input data from tokens of the visible data. Current MAE approaches for videos rely on random patch, tube, or frame based masking strategies to select these tokens. This paper proposes AdaMAE, an adaptive masking strategy for MAEs that is end-to-end trainable. Our adaptive masking strategy samples visible tokens based on the semantic context using an auxiliary sampling network. This network estimates a categorical distribution over spacetime-patch tokens. The tokens that increase the expected reconstruction error are rewarded and selected as visible tokens, motivated by the policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning. We show that AdaMAE samples more tokens from the high spatiotemporal information regions, thereby allowing us to mask 95% of tokens, resulting in lower memory requirements and faster pre-training. We conduct ablation studies on the Something-Something v2 (SSv2) dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive sampling approach and report state-of-the-art results of 70.0% and 81.7% in top-1 accuracy on SSv2 and Kinetics-400 action classification datasets with a ViT-Base backbone and 800 pre-training epochs.

Rawat",2023,"We have seen great progress in video action recognition in recent years. There are several models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and some recent transformer based approaches which provide top performance on existing benchmarks. In this work, we perform a large-scale robustness analysis of these existing models for video action recognition. We focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift perturbations instead of adversarial perturbations. We propose four different benchmark datasets, HMDB51-P, UCF101-P, Kinetics400-P, and SSv2-P to perform this analysis. We study robustness of six state-of-the-art action recognition models against 90 different perturbations. The study reveals some interesting findings, 1) Transformer based models are consistently more robust compared to CNN based models, 2) Pre-training improves robustness for Transformer based models more than CNN based models, and 3) All of the studied models are robust to temporal perturbations for all datasets but SSv2; suggesting the importance of temporal information for action recognition varies based on the dataset and activities. Next, we study the role of augmentations in model robustness and present a real-world dataset, UCF101-DS, which contains realistic distribution shifts, to further validate some of these findings.

However, living in the dynamically changing open world where unknown actions constantly spring up, the closed-set assumption of existing WTAL methods is invalid. Compared with traditional open-set recognition tasks, Open-world WTAL (OWTAL) is challenging since not only are the annotations of unknown samples unavailable, but also the fine-grained annotations of known action instances can only be inferred ambiguously from the video category labels. To address this problem, we propose a Cascade Evidential Learning framework at an evidence level, which targets at OWTAL for the first time. Our method jointly leverages multi-scale temporal contexts and knowledge-guided prototype information to progressively collect cascade and enhanced evidence for known action, unknown action, and background separation. Extensive experiments conducted on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3 verify the effectiveness of our method. Besides the classification metrics adopted by previous open-set recognition methods, we also evaluate our method on localization metrics which are more reasonable for OWTAL.",data/CVPR20232023/Cascade Evidential Learning for Open-World Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Chen_Cascade_Evidential_Learning_for_Open-World_Weakly-Supervised_Temporal_Action_Localization_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Existing multi-modal VQA models achieve promising performance on images or short video clips, especially with the recent success of large-scale multi-modal pre-training. However, when extending these methods to long-form videos, new challenges arise. On the one hand, using a dense video sampling strategy is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, methods relying on sparse sampling struggle in scenarios where multi-event and multi-granularity visual reasoning are required. In this work, we introduce a new model named Multi-modal Iterative Spatial-temporal Transformer (MIST) to better adapt pre-trained models for long-form VideoQA. Specifically, MIST decomposes traditional dense spatial-temporal self-attention into cascaded segment and region selection modules that adaptively select frames and image regions that are closely relevant to the question itself. Visual concepts at different granularities are then processed efficiently through an attention module. In addition, MIST iteratively conducts selection and attention over multiple layers to support reasoning over multiple events. The experimental results on four VideoQA datasets, including AGQA, NExT-QA, STAR, and Env-QA, show that MIST achieves state-of-the-art performance and is superior at computation efficiency and interpretability.",data/CVPR20232023/MIST: Multi-Modal Iterative Spatial-Temporal Transformer for Long-Form Video Question Answering.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Gao_MIST_Multi-Modal_Iterative_Spatial-Temporal_Transformer_for_Long-Form_Video_Question_Answering_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5,Source-Free Video Domain Adaptation With Spatial-Temporal-Historical Consistency Learning,CVPR2023,"Kai Li, Deep Patel, Erik Kruus, Martin Renqiang Min",2023,"Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an emerging research topic that studies how to adapt a pretrained source model using unlabeled target data. It is derived from unsupervised domain adaptation but has the advantage of not requiring labeled source data to learn adaptive models. This makes it particularly useful in real-world applications where access to source data is restricted. While there has been some SFDA work for images, little attention has been paid to videos. Naively extending image-based methods to videos without considering the unique properties of videos often leads to unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a simple and highly flexible method for Source-Free Video Domain Adaptation (SFVDA), which extensively exploits consistency learning for videos from spatial, temporal, and historical perspectives. Our method is based on the assumption that videos of the same action category are drawn from the same low-dimensional space, regardless of the spatio-temporal variations in the high-dimensional space that cause domain shifts. To overcome domain shifts, we simulate spatio-temporal variations by applying spatial and temporal augmentations on target videos, and encourage the model to make consistent predictions from a video and its augmented versions. Due to the simple design, our method can be applied to various SFVDA settings, and experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for all the settings.",data/CVPR20232023/Source-Free Video Domain Adaptation With Spatial-Temporal-Historical Consistency Learning.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Li_Source-Free_Video_Domain_Adaptation_With_Spatial-Temporal-Historical_Consistency_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,Ultrahigh Resolution Image/Video Matting With Spatio-Temporal Sparsity,CVPR2023,"Yanan Sun, Chi-Keung Tang, Yu-Wing Tai",2023,"Commodity ultra-high definition (UHD) displays are becoming more affordable which demand imaging in ultra high resolution (UHR). This paper proposes SparseMat, a computationally efficient approach for UHR image/video matting. Note that it is infeasible to directly process UHR images at full resolution in one shot using existing matting algorithms without running out of memory on consumer-level computational platforms, e.g., Nvidia 1080Ti with 11G memory, while patch-based approaches can introduce unsightly artifacts due to patch partitioning. Instead, our method resorts to spatial and temporal sparsity for solving general UHR matting. During processing videos, huge computation redundancy can be reduced through the rational use of spatial and temporal sparsity. In this paper, we show how to effectively estimate spatio-temporal sparsity, which serves as a gate to activate input pixels for the matting model. Under the guidance of such sparsity, our method discards patch-based inference in lieu of memory-efficient and full-resolution matte refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseMat can effectively and efficiently generate high-quality alpha matte for UHR images and videos in one shot.",data/CVPR20232023/Ultrahigh Resolution Image/Video Matting With Spatio-Temporal Sparsity.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Sun_Ultrahigh_Resolution_ImageVideo_Matting_With_Spatio-Temporal_Sparsity_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7,Learning Discriminative Representations for Skeleton Based Action Recognition,CVPR2023,"Huanyu Zhou, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang",2023,"Human action recognition aims at classifying the category of human action from a segment of a video. Recently, people have dived into designing GCN-based models to extract features from skeletons for performing this task, because skeleton representations are much more efficient and robust than other modalities such as RGB frames. However, when employing the skeleton data, some important clues like related items are also discarded. It results in some ambiguous actions that are hard to be distinguished and tend to be misclassified. To alleviate this problem, we propose an auxiliary feature refinement head (FR Head), which consists of spatial-temporal decoupling and contrastive feature refinement, to obtain discriminative representations of skeletons. Ambiguous samples are dynamically discovered and calibrated in the feature space. Furthermore, FR Head could be imposed on different stages of GCNs to build a multi-level refinement for stronger supervision. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets. Our proposed models obtain competitive results from state-of-the-art methods and can help to discriminate those ambiguous samples.

However, most existing works do not explicitly consider the general case where the device's state and the available resources fluctuate over time, and none of them investigate or address the impact of varying computational resources for online video understanding tasks. This paper proposes a System-status-aware Adaptive Network (SAN) that considers the device's real-time state to provide high-quality predictions with low delay. Usage of our agent's policy improves efficiency and robustness to fluctuations of the system status. On two widely used video understanding tasks, SAN obtains state-of-the-art performance while constantly keeping processing delays low. Moreover, training such an agent on various types of hardware configurations is not easy as the labeled training data might not be available, or can be computationally prohibitive. To address this challenging problem, we propose a Meta Self-supervised Adaptation (MSA) method that adapts the agent's policy to new hardware configurations at test-time, allowing for easy deployment of the model onto other unseen hardware platforms.",data/CVPR20232023/System-Status-Aware Adaptive Network for Online Streaming Video Understanding.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Foo_System-Status-Aware_Adaptive_Network_for_Online_Streaming_Video_Understanding_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9,Boosting Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization With Text Information,CVPR2023,"Guozhang Li, De Cheng, Xinpeng Ding, Nannan Wang, Xiaoyu Wang, Xinbo Gao",2023,"Due to the lack of temporal annotation, current Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods are generally stuck into over-complete or incomplete localization. In this paper, we aim to leverage the text information to boost WTAL from two aspects, i.e., (a) the discriminative objective to enlarge the inter-class difference, thus reducing the over-complete; (b) the generative objective to enhance the intra-class integrity, thus finding more complete temporal boundaries. For the discriminative objective, we propose a Text-Segment Mining (TSM) mechanism, which constructs a text description based on the action class label, and regards the text as the query to mine all class-related segments. Without the temporal annotation of actions, TSM compares the text query with the entire videos across the dataset to mine the best matching segments while ignoring irrelevant ones. Due to the shared sub-actions in different categories of videos, merely applying TSM is too strict to neglect the semantic-related segments, which results in incomplete localization. We further introduce a generative objective named Video-text Language Completion (VLC), which focuses on all semantic-related segments from videos to complete the text sentence. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3.

Due to the small amount of available annotations, a key challenge in procedure understanding is to be able to extract from unlabeled videos the procedural knowledge such as the identity of the task (e.g., 'make latte'), its steps (e.g., 'pour milk'), or the potential next steps given partial progress in its execution. Our main insight is that instructional videos depict sequences of steps that repeat between instances of the same or different tasks, and that this structure can be well represented by a Procedural Knowledge Graph (PKG), where nodes are discrete steps and edges connect steps that occur sequentially in the instructional activities. This graph can then be used to generate pseudo labels to train a video representation that encodes the procedural knowledge in a more accessible form to generalize to multiple procedure understanding tasks. We build a PKG by combining information from a text-based procedural knowledge database and an unlabeled instructional video corpus and then use it to generate training pseudo labels with four novel pre-training objectives. We call this PKG-based pre-training procedure and the resulting model Paprika, Procedure-Aware PRe-training for Instructional Knowledge Acquisition. We evaluate Paprika on COIN and CrossTask for procedure understanding tasks such as task recognition, step recognition, and step forecasting.

Existing methods mainly focus on learning better uncertainty scores but dismiss the importance of feature representations. We find that features with richer semantic diversity can significantly improve the open-set performance under the same uncertainty scores. In this paper, we begin with analyzing the feature representation behavior in the open-set action recognition (OSAR) problem based on the information bottleneck (IB) theory, and propose to enlarge the instance-specific (IS) and class-specific (CS) information contained in the feature for better performance. To this end, a novel Prototypical Similarity Learning (PSL) framework is proposed to keep the instance variance within the same class to retain more IS information. Besides, we notice that unknown samples sharing similar appearances to known samples are easily misclassified as known classes. To alleviate this issue, video shuffling is further introduced in our PSL to learn distinct temporal information between original and shuffled samples, which we find enlarges the CS information.

Recently, a few query-based action detectors are proposed to predict action instances in an end-to-end manner. However, they still lack adaptability in feature sampling or decoding, thus suffering from the issue of inferior performance or slower convergence. In this paper, we propose a new one-stage sparse action detector, termed STMixer. STMixer is based on two core designs. First, we present a query-based adaptive feature sampling module, which endows our STMixer with the flexibility of mining a set of discriminative features from the entire spatiotemporal domain. Second, we devise a dual-branch feature mixing module, which allows our STMixer to dynamically attend to and mix video features along the spatial and the temporal dimension respectively for better feature decoding.

Despite its widespread adoption, the decision procedure of the network still lacks transparency and interpretability, making it difficult to enhance the performance further.

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) investigates the relationship between input images or videos and output predictions. Recent studies have achieved outstanding success in explaining 2D image classification ConvNets. On the other hand, due to the high computation cost and complexity of video data, the explanation of 3D video recognition ConvNets is relatively less studied. And none of them are able to produce a high-level explanation. In this paper, we propose a STCE (Spatial-temporal Concept-based Explanation) framework for interpreting 3D ConvNets. In our approach: (1) videos are represented with high-level supervoxels, similar supervoxels are clustered as a concept, which is straightforward for human to understand; and (2) the interpreting framework calculates a score for each concept, which reflects its significance in the ConvNet decision procedure.

Frame selection aims to extract the most informative and representative frames to help a model better understand video content. Existing frame selection methods either individually sample frames based on per-frame importance prediction, without considering interaction among frames, or adopt reinforcement learning agents to find representative frames in succession, which are costly to train and may lead to potential stability issues. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a Search-Map-Search learning paradigm which combines the advantages of heuristic search and supervised learning to select the best combination of frames from a video as one entity. By combining search with learning, the proposed method can better capture frame interactions while incurring a low inference overhead. Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical search method conducted on each training video to search for the optimal combination of frames with the lowest error on the downstream task.

19,Towards High-Quality and Efficient Video Super-Resolution via Spatial-Temporal Data Overfitting,CVPR2023,"Gen Li, Jie Ji, Minghai Qin, Wei Niu, Bin Ren, Fatemeh Afghah, Linke Guo, Xiaolong Ma",2023,"As deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in various fields of computer vision, leveraging the overfitting ability of the DNN to achieve video resolution upscaling has become a new trend in the modern video delivery system. By dividing videos into chunks and overfitting each chunk with a super-resolution model, the server encodes videos before transmitting them to the clients, thus achieving better video quality and transmission efficiency. However, a large number of chunks are expected to ensure good overfitting quality, which substantially increases the storage and consumes more bandwidth resources for data transmission. On the other hand, decreasing the number of chunks through training optimization techniques usually requires high model capacity, which significantly slows down execution speed. To reconcile such, we propose a novel method for high-quality and efficient video resolution upscaling tasks, which leverages the spatial-temporal information to accurately divide video into chunks, thus keeping the number of chunks as well as the model size to a minimum. Additionally, we advance our method into a single overfitting model by a data-aware joint training technique, which further reduces the storage requirement with negligible quality drop. We deploy our proposed overfitting models on an off-the-shelf mobile phone, and experimental results show that our method achieves real-time video super-resolution with high video quality.

The key to video restoration depends on utilizing inter-frame information. However, existing deep learning methods often rely on complicated network architectures, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, resulting in high computational costs. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective framework for video restoration. Our approach is based on grouped spatial-temporal shift, which is a lightweight and straightforward technique that can implicitly capture inter-frame correspondences for multi-frame aggregation. By introducing grouped spatial shift, we attain expansive effective receptive fields. Combined with basic 2D convolution, this simple framework can effectively aggregate inter-frame information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, while using less than a quarter of its computational cost, on both video deblurring and video denoising tasks.

Most methods widely adopt the off-the-shelf Classification-Based Pre-training (CBP) to generate video features for action localization. However, the different optimization objectives between classification and localization, make temporally localized results suffer from the serious incomplete issue. To tackle this issue without additional annotations, this paper considers to distill free action knowledge from Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), as we surprisingly observe that the localization results of vanilla VLP have an over-complete issue, which is just complementary to the CBP results. To fuse such complementarity, we propose a novel distillation-collaboration framework with two branches acting as CBP and VLP respectively. The framework is optimized through a dual-branch alternate training strategy. Specifically, during the B step, we distill the confident background pseudo-labels from the CBP branch; while during the F step, the confident foreground pseudo-labels are distilled from the VLP branch. As a result, the dual-branch complementarity is effectively fused to promote one strong alliance.

The recently proposed Structured State-Space Sequence (S4) model with its linear complexity offers a promising direction in this space. However, we demonstrate that treating all image-tokens equally as done by S4 model can adversely affect its efficiency and accuracy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Selective S4 (i.e., S5) model that employs a lightweight mask generator to adaptively select informative image tokens resulting in more efficient and accurate modeling of long-term spatiotemporal dependencies in videos. Unlike previous mask-based token reduction methods used in transformers, our S5 model avoids the dense self-attention calculation by making use of the guidance of the momentum-updated S4 model. This enables our model to efficiently discard less informative tokens and adapt to various long-form video understanding tasks more effectively. However, as is the case for most token reduction methods, the informative image tokens could be dropped incorrectly. To improve the robustness and the temporal horizon of our model, we propose a novel long-short masked contrastive learning (LSMCL) approach that enables our model to predict longer temporal context using shorter input videos.

This is in contrast to prior works which either drop tokens at the cost of accuracy, or increase accuracy whilst also increasing the computation required. First, we propose an object-guided token sampling strategy that enables us to retain a small fraction of the input tokens with minimal impact on accuracy.

This is hampered by the difficulties of representing the spatial-temporal information of events when guiding VSR. To this end, we propose a novel framework that incorporates the spatial-temporal interpolation of events to VSR in a unified framework. Our key idea is to learn implicit neural representations from queried spatial-temporal coordinates and features from both RGB frames and events. Our method contains three parts. Specifically, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) module first learns the 3D features from events and RGB frames. Then, the Temporal Filter (TF) module unlocks more explicit motion information from the events near the queried timestamp and generates the 2D features. Lastly, the Spatial-Temporal Implicit Representation (STIR) module recovers the SR frame in arbitrary resolutions from the outputs of these two modules.

We present a unified, user prompt-guided zero-shot learning framework using a target domain-independent skeleton feature extractor, which is pretrained on a large-scale action recognition dataset. Particularly, during the training phase using normal samples, the method models the distribution of skeleton features of the normal actions while freezing the weights of the DNNs and estimates the anomaly score using this distribution in the inference phase. Additionally, to increase robustness against skeleton errors, we introduce a DNN architecture inspired by a point cloud deep learning paradigm, which sparsely propagates the features between joints. Furthermore, to prevent the unobserved normal actions from being misidentified as abnormal actions, we incorporate a similarity score between the user prompt embeddings and skeleton features aligned in the common space into the anomaly score, which indirectly supplements normal actions.

Nevertheless, to calculate the joint-to-joint affinity matrix, the computational cost has a quadratic growth with the increasing number of joints. Such drawback becomes even worse especially for pose estimation in a video sequence, which necessitates spatio-temporal correlation spanning over the entire video. In this paper, we facilitate the issue by decomposing correlation learning into space and time, and present a novel Spatio-Temporal Criss-cross attention (STC) block. Technically, STC first slices its input feature into two partitions evenly along the channel dimension, followed by performing spatial and temporal attention respectively on each partition. STC then models the interactions between joints in an identical frame and joints in an identical trajectory simultaneously by concatenating the outputs from attention layers. On this basis, we devise STCFormer by stacking multiple STC blocks and further integrate a new Structure-enhanced Positional Embedding (SPE) into STCFormer to take the structure of human body into consideration. The embedding function consists of two components: spatio-temporal convolution around neighboring joints to capture local structure, and part-aware embedding to indicate which part each joint belongs to. Extensive experiments are conducted on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks, and superior results are reported when comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches. More remarkably, STCFormer achieves to-date the best published performance: 40.5mm P1 error on the challenging Human3.6M dataset.",data/CVPR20232023/3D Human Pose Estimation With Spatio-Temporal Criss-Cross Attention.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Tang_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_With_Spatio-Temporal_Criss-Cross_Attention_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Transferring knowledge from such powerful VLMs is a promising direction for building effective video recognition models. However, current exploration in this field is still limited. We believe that the greatest value of pre-trained VLMs lies in building a bridge between visual and textual domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called BIKE, which utilizes the cross-modal bridge to explore bidirectional knowledge: i) We introduce the Video Attribute Association mechanism, which leverages the Video-to-Text knowledge to generate textual auxiliary attributes for complementing video recognition. ii) We also present a Temporal Concept Spotting mechanism that uses the Text-to-Video expertise to capture temporal saliency in a parameter-free manner, leading to enhanced video representation.

To address this issue, we construct a new multi-person long-form video dataset for action quality assessment named LOGO. Distinguished in scenario complexity, our dataset contains 200 videos from 26 artistic swimming events with 8 athletes in each sample along with an average duration of 204.2 seconds. As for richness in annotations, LOGO includes formation labels to depict group information of multiple athletes and detailed annotations on action procedures. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to model relations among athletes and reason about the potential temporal logic in long-form videos. Specifically, we design a group-aware attention module, which can be easily plugged into existing AQA methods, to enrich the clip-wise representations based on contextual group information. To benchmark LOGO, we systematically conduct investigations on the performance of several popular methods in AQA and action segmentation. The results reveal the challenges our dataset brings.

In the feature pyramid of TriDet, we propose a Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer to aggregate information across different temporal granularities, which is much more efficient than the recent transformer-based feature pyramid.

Our Beta Evidential Neural Network estimates multi-action uncertainty with Beta densities based on actor-context-object relation representations. An evidence debiasing constraint is added to the objective func- tion for optimization to reduce the static bias of video representations, which can incorrectly correlate predictions and static cues. We develop a primal-dual average scheme update-based learning algorithm to optimize the proposed problem and provide corresponding theoretical analysis.

A point cloud deep-learning paradigm is introduced to the action recognition, and a unified framework along with a novel deep neural network architecture called Structured Keypoint Pooling is proposed. The proposed method sparsely aggregates keypoint features in a cascaded manner based on prior knowledge of the data structure (which is inherent in skeletons), such as the instances and frames to which each keypoint belongs, and achieves robustness against input errors. Its less constrained and tracking-free architecture enables time-series keypoints consisting of human skeletons and nonhuman object contours to be efficiently treated as an input 3D point cloud and extends the variety of the targeted action. Furthermore, we propose a Pooling-Switching Trick inspired by Structured Keypoint Pooling. This trick switches the pooling kernels between the training and inference phases to detect person-wise and frame-wise actions in a weakly supervised manner using only video-level action labels. This trick enables our training scheme to naturally introduce novel data augmentation, which mixes multiple point clouds extracted from different videos.

Pseudo-label-based methods, which serve as an effective solution, have been widely studied recently. However, existing methods generate pseudo labels during training and make predictions during testing under different pipelines or settings, resulting in a gap between training and testing. In this paper, we propose to generate high-quality pseudo labels from the predicted action boundaries. Nevertheless, we note that existing post-processing, like NMS, would lead to information loss, which is insufficient to generate high-quality action boundaries. More importantly, transforming action boundaries into pseudo labels is quite challenging, since the predicted action instances are generally overlapped and have different confidence scores. Besides, the generated pseudo-labels can be fluctuating and inaccurate at the early stage of training. It might repeatedly strengthen the false predictions if there is no mechanism to conduct self-correction. To tackle these issues, we come up with an effective pipeline for learning better pseudo labels. Firstly, we propose a Gaussian weighted fusion module to preserve information of action instances and obtain high-quality action boundaries. Second, we formulate the pseudo-label generation as an optimization problem under the constraints in terms of the confidence scores of action instances. Finally, we introduce the idea of Delta pseudo labels, which enables the model with the ability of self-correction.

To this end, we devise a learnable dictionary where entries are the class centroids of the corresponding action categories. The representations of snippets identified as the same action category are induced to be close to the same class centroid, which guides the network to perceive the semantics of frames and avoid unreasonable localization.

Inspired by the great success of image-text pre-training (e.g., CLIP), we take the first step to exploit language semantics to boost transferable spatiotemporal representation learning.

This pre-processing step would temporally downsample the video, reducing the inference resolution and hampering the detection performance in the original temporal resolution. In essence, this is due to a temporal quantization error introduced during the resolution downsampling and recovery. This could negatively impact the TAD performance, but is largely ignored by existing methods. To address this problem, in this work we introduce a novel model-agnostic post-processing method without model redesign and retraining. Specifically, we model the start and end points of action instances with a Gaussian distribution for enabling temporal boundary inference at a sub-snippet level. We further introduce an efficient Taylor-expansion based approximation, dubbed as Gaussian Approximated Post-processing (GAP).

However, learning such encoders without labels continues to be a challenging problem. While prior works have shown promising results by applying contrastive learning to pose sequences, the quality of the learned representations is often observed to be closely tied to data augmentations that are used to craft the positives. However, augmenting pose sequences is a difficult task as the geometric constraints among the skeleton joints need to be enforced to make the augmentations realistic for that action. In this work, we propose a new contrastive learning approach to train models for skeleton-based action recognition without labels. Our key contribution is a simple module, HaLP - to Hallucinate Latent Positives for contrastive learning. Specifically, HaLP explores the latent space of poses in suitable directions to generate new positives. To this end, we present a novel optimization formulation to solve for the synthetic positives with an explicit control on their hardness. We propose approximations to the objective, making them solvable in closed form with minimal overhead. We show via experiments that using these generated positives within a standard contrastive learning framework leads to consistent improvements across benchmarks such as NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-II on tasks like linear evaluation, transfer learning, and kNN evaluation.

57,Latency Matters: Real-Time Action Forecasting Transformer,CVPR2023,"Harshayu Girase, Nakul Agarwal, Chiho Choi, Karttikeya Mangalam",2023,"We present RAFTformer, a real-time action forecasting transformer for latency aware real-world action forecasting applications. RAFTformer is a two-stage fully transformer based architecture which consists of a video transformer backbone that operates on high resolution, short range clips and a head transformer encoder that temporally aggregates information from multiple short range clips to span a long-term horizon. Additionally, we propose a self-supervised shuffled causal masking scheme to improve model generalization during training. Finally, we also propose a real-time evaluation setting that directly couples model inference latency to overall forecasting performance and brings forth an hitherto overlooked trade-off between latency and action forecasting performance. Our parsimonious network design facilitates RAFTformer inference latency to be 9x smaller than prior works at the same forecasting accuracy. Owing to its two-staged design, RAFTformer uses 94% less training compute and 90% lesser training parameters to outperform prior state-of-the-art baselines by 4.9 points on EGTEA Gaze+ and by 1.4 points on EPIC-Kitchens-100 dataset, as measured by Top-5 recall (T5R) in the offline setting. In the real-time setting, RAFTformer outperforms prior works by an even greater margin of upto 4.4 T5R points on the EPIC-Kitchens-100 dataset.

Existing approaches mainly use convolutional neural networks, yet current revolutionary vision transformer models have been less explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of transformer models under the SSL setting for action recognition. To this end, we introduce SVFormer, which adopts a steady pseudo-labeling framework (ie, EMA-Teacher) to cope with unlabeled video samples. While a wide range of data augmentations have been shown effective for semi-supervised image classification, they generally produce limited results for video recognition. We therefore introduce a novel augmentation strategy, Tube TokenMix, tailored for video data where video clips are mixed via a mask with consistent masked tokens over the temporal axis. In addition, we propose a temporal warping augmentation to cover the complex temporal variation in videos, which stretches selected frames to various temporal durations in the clip. Extensive experiments on three datasets Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 verify the advantage of SVFormer. In particular, SVFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art by 31.5% with fewer training epochs under the 1% labeling rate of Kinetics-400. Our method can hopefully serve as a strong benchmark and encourage future search on semi-supervised action recognition with Transformer networks.",data/CVPR20232023/SVFormer: Semi-Supervised Video Transformer for Action Recognition.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Xing_SVFormer_Semi-Supervised_Video_Transformer_for_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gold standard Motion capture (MoCap) systems are accurate but inaccessible to the general public due to their cost, hardware, and space constraints. In contrast, monocular human mesh recovery (HMR) methods are much more accessible than MoCap as they take single-view videos as inputs. Replacing the multi-view MoCap systems with a monocular HMR method would break the current barriers to collecting accurate 3D motion thus making exciting applications like motion analysis and motion-driven animation accessible to the general public. However, the performance of existing HMR methods degrades when the video contains challenging and dynamic motion that is not in existing MoCap datasets used for training. This reduces its appeal as dynamic motion is frequently the target in 3D motion recovery in the aforementioned applications. Our study aims to bridge the gap between monocular HMR and multi-view MoCap systems by leveraging information shared across multiple video instances of the same action. We introduce the Neural Motion (NeMo) field. It is optimized to represent the underlying 3D motions across a set of videos of the same action. Empirically, we show that NeMo can recover 3D motion in sports using videos from the Penn Action dataset, where NeMo outperforms existing HMR methods in terms of 2D keypoint detection. To further validate NeMo using 3D metrics, we collected a small MoCap dataset mimicking actions in Penn Action, and show that NeMo achieves better 3D reconstruction compared to various baselines.",data/CVPR20232023/NeMo: Learning 3D Neural Motion Fields From Multiple Video Instances of the Same Action.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wang_NeMo_Learning_3D_Neural_Motion_Fields_From_Multiple_Video_Instances_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is a challenging task in which the model should well understand dynamic visual cues (e.g., motions) and static visual cues (e.g., object appearances) in the language description, which requires effective joint modeling of spatio-temporal visual-linguistic dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel framework in which a static vision-language stream and a dynamic vision-language stream are developed to collaboratively reason the target tube. The static stream performs cross-modal understanding in a single frame and learns to attend to the target object spatially according to intra-frame visual cues like object appearances. The dynamic stream models visual-linguistic dependencies across multiple consecutive frames to capture dynamic cues like motions. We further design a novel cross-stream collaborative block between the two streams, which enables the static and dynamic streams to transfer useful and complementary information from each other to achieve collaborative reasoning. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the collaboration of the two streams and our overall framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both HCSTVG and VidSTG datasets.",data/CVPR20232023/Collaborative Static and Dynamic Vision-Language Streams for Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Lin_Collaborative_Static_and_Dynamic_Vision-Language_Streams_for_Spatio-Temporal_Video_Grounding_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Existing techniques achieve such alignment by exploiting dense boundary and bounding box annotations, which can be prohibitively expensive. To bridge the gap, we investigate the weakly-supervised setting, where models learn from easily accessible video-language data without annotations. We identify that intra-sample spurious correlations among video-language components can be alleviated if the model captures the decomposed structures of video and language data. In this light, we propose a novel framework, namely WINNER, for hierarchical video-text understanding. WINNER first builds the language decomposition tree in a bottom-up manner, upon which the structural attention mechanism and top-down feature backtracking jointly build a multi-modal decomposition tree, permitting a hierarchical understanding of unstructured videos. The multi-modal decomposition tree serves as the basis for multi-hierarchy language-tube matching. A hierarchical contrastive learning objective is proposed to learn the multi-hierarchy correspondence and distinguishment with intra-sample and inter-sample video-text decomposition structures, achieving video-language decomposition structure alignment.

Li",2023,"Spatiotemporal predictive learning aims to generate future frames by learning from historical frames. In this paper, we investigate existing methods and present a general framework of spatiotemporal predictive learning, in which the spatial encoder and decoder capture intra-frame features and the middle temporal module catches inter-frame correlations. While the mainstream methods employ recurrent units to capture long-term temporal dependencies, they suffer from low computational efficiency due to their unparallelizable architectures. To parallelize the temporal module, we propose the Temporal Attention Unit (TAU), which decomposes temporal attention into intra-frame statical attention and inter-frame dynamical attention. Moreover, while the mean squared error loss focuses on intra-frame errors, we introduce a novel differential divergence regularization to take inter-frame variations into account. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables the derived model to achieve competitive performance on various spatiotemporal prediction benchmarks.",data/CVPR20232023/Temporal Attention Unit: Towards Efficient Spatiotemporal Predictive Learning.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Tan_Temporal_Attention_Unit_Towards_Efficient_Spatiotemporal_Predictive_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Most recent works approach WTAL from a localization-by-classification perspective where these methods try to classify each video frame followed by a manually-designed post-processing pipeline to aggregate these per-frame action predictions into action snippets. Due to this perspective, the model lacks any explicit understanding of action boundaries and tends to focus only on the most discriminative parts of the video resulting in incomplete action localization. To address this, we present PivoTAL, Prior-driven Supervision for Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization, to approach WTAL from a localization-by-localization perspective by learning to localize the action snippets directly. To this end, PivoTAL leverages the underlying spatio-temporal regularities in videos in the form of action-specific scene prior, action snippet generation prior, and learnable Gaussian prior to supervise the localization-based training.

64,AUNet: Learning Relations Between Action Units for Face Forgery Detection,CVPR2023,"Weiming Bai, Yufan Liu, Zhipeng Zhang, Bing Li, Weiming Hu",2023,"Face forgery detection becomes increasingly crucial due to the serious security issues caused by face manipulation techniques. Recent studies in deepfake detection have yielded promising results when the training and testing face forgeries are from the same domain. However, the problem remains challenging when one tries to generalize the detector to forgeries created by unseen methods during training. Observing that face manipulation may alter the relation between different facial action units (AU), we propose the Action Units Relation Learning framework to improve the generality of forgery detection. In specific, it consists of the Action Units Relation Transformer (ART) and the Tampered AU Prediction (TAP). The ART constructs the relation between different AUs with AU-agnostic Branch and AU-specific Branch, which complement each other and work together to exploit forgery clues. In the Tampered AU Prediction, we tamper AU-related regions at the image level and develop challenging pseudo samples at the feature level. The model is then trained to predict the tampered AU regions with the generated location-specific supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both the in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.",data/CVPR20232023/AUNet: Learning Relations Between Action Units for Face Forgery Detection.pdf,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Bai_AUNet_Learning_Relations_Between_Action_Units_for_Face_Forgery_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
65,MoLo: Motion-Augmented Long-Short Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot Action Recognition,CVPR2023,"Xiang Wang, Shiwei Zhang, Zhiwu Qing, Changxin Gao, Yingya Zhang, Deli Zhao, Nong Sang",2023,"Current state-of-the-art approaches for few-shot action recognition achieve promising performance by conducting frame-level matching on learned visual features. However, they generally suffer from two limitations: i) the matching procedure between local frames tends to be inaccurate due to the lack of guidance to force long-range temporal perception; ii) explicit motion learning is usually ignored, leading to partial information loss. To address these issues, we develop a Motion-augmented Long-short Contrastive Learning (MoLo) method that contains two crucial components, including a long-short contrastive objective and a motion autodecoder. Specifically, the long-short contrastive objective is to endow local frame features with long-form temporal awareness by maximizing their agreement with the global token of videos belonging to the same class. The motion autodecoder is a lightweight architecture to reconstruct pixel motions from the differential features, which explicitly embeds the network with motion dynamics. By this means, MoLo can simultaneously learn long-range temporal context and motion cues for comprehensive few-shot matching. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate MoLo on five standard benchmarks, and the results show that MoLo favorably outperforms recent advanced methods.
